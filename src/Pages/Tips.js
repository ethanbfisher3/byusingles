            <p>
              BYU is full of events for boys and girls to get out of the
              apartment and get to know each other! For example:
            </p>
            <ul className="byu-events-list">
              <li>Ward Activites (Family Home Evening, Ward Prayer)</li>
              <li>
                College Events (Engineering Activites, Foreign Language Events,
                etc.)
              </li>
              <li>YServe Events</li>

            <p>
              BYU has a plethora of classes. Obviously, lots of the ones you are
              taking are major-specific. Depending on your major, that could
              mean you're already in classes with lots of cuties, or you're in
              Computer Science and surrounded by boy nerds. However, despite
              having a major without girls, here's a list of the best classes to
              find cute girls to date.

            <h2 style={{ margin: "20px 0px" }}>Tip 2: Referrals!</h2>
            <p>
              If you're a returned missionary, you probably know what we mean
              when we say <strong>work with members</strong>. You aren't the
              only one that has to be looking for girls for you. Your roommates,
              close friends, and family can all be looking for girls that you
              can date.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
              Here are some ways to get referrals:
            </p>
            <ul className="referral-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Classmates</strong>: Ask friends in your classes about
                their dating lives. See if they could get you in touch with a
                friend of theirs, their girlfriend's roommates, coworkers, etc.
              </li>
              <li style={{ margin: "10px 0px" }}>
                <strong>Roommates</strong>: Ask your roommates about their
                friends. Most likely they have some friends who are girls that
                you could hang out with. Maybe you date them, or you begin to
                ask those girls who you could date. Simple!
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Family</strong>: If you have family in the Utah area,
                you're in luck! Your family has their own ward to go to, and
                many times there are girls at college from Utah who go to church
                back with their families. You could try going to church with
                your families or asking your family if there are cute girls in
                their wards.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div id="tip-3">
            <h2 style={{ margin: "20px 0px" }}>Tip 3: Mutual</h2>
            <p>
              There's a reason Mutual is so popular. It works! It's like getting
              media referrals through Facebook on the mission. You're
              immediately put in an environment where there are girls wanting to
              date. You can easily get dates with cute girls and find your
              soulmate after just a few minutes making an account and looking
              around.

          <div id="tip-4">
            <h2 style={{ margin: "20px 0px" }}>Tip 4: Be Confident!</h2>
            <p>
              Confidence plays a crucial role in attracting girls at BYU. It
              shows girls that you believe in yourself, that you value yourself
              as a son of God and that you know how to treat a woman.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              One thing that is important to note is that confidence is not
              cockiness or pride. Never at any time should you act in such a
              way, because you will cause the girl to be uninterested in you,
              likely for the rest of your life.
